# UAT
For this assignment, you are a programmer for the UAT Space Program.  It is your duty to create the launch sequence for takeoff.  To do this, you will need to create an HTML file.  Then using JavaScript in the HTML file,  display a count from 10 to 0 in 1 second increments then print out a message that says “Blastoff" when the timer says zero!

Do not use an alert message, just print to the screen.

There are many ways to do this, one way is using JavaScript code like the following:

document.getElementById("DisplayCountdown").innerHTML = countdown;
 
You will need to create the variable initialize it to 10. 
You will decrement currTme by 1. 
Then you will repeat this 10 times (cut and paste).  Later we’ll use loops so you don’t have to cut and paste. 
After the countdown reaches zero, print Blastoff!
Have at least 1 creative element – images, fonts, background color,etc. 
Create a nice look and feel for the user.
Comment above almost every line of your code
Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.
You CANNOT turn in my example code.  It must be significantly customized.
Objectives
Use a library function
Create Variables
Output variables
Requirements
Write a .html with JavaScript code that:

counts down from 10 to 0 using a variable
decrements the variable
outputs Blastoff when the countdown time = 0
NOTE: You must have the function in a Javascript file and must have a .css file as well.
Deliverables
 Submit a .html to this assignment.
